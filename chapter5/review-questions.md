# Chapter 5: Review Questions

Q1: B  
Q2: E  
Q3: A,B,D,E  
Q4: C,E  
Q5: A,D,E,F  
__Q6__: D => This question seems to be worded incorrectly. It does not say which lines are incorrect, it says the code will not compile because of line X. So the explanation in the appendix on page 347 doesn't sound right. Hopefully the questions in the real exam are much clearer.  
Q7: B,C  
Q8: F  
Q9: A  
__Q10__: B,C,E,F  
Q11: A,D,E  
Q12: B  
Q13: A  
__Q14__: C => The term "class" also includes abstract classes.  
Q15: B  
Q16: E  
Q17: B  
Q18: E  
Q19: A,C,F  
__Q20__: A => Since the object reference is associated with the class Bird, it looks in this class for the method. Since the method was never overridden in a subclass, the method in Bird is the most specific one.

## Notes

Since default methods were added with Java 8, not all methods are implicitly abstract.

Interfaces do not have a base class. Therefore they are no subclasses/subtypes of java.lang.Object.
