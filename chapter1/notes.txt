- the package java.lang.* is imported automatically


import java.nio.*;              // NO GOOD – a wildcard only matches
                                //class names, not "file.*Files"
import java.nio.*.*;            // NO GOOD – you can only have one wildcard
                                //and it must be at the end
import java.nio.files.Paths.*;  // NO GOOD – you cannot import methods
                                //only class names

- implicitly imported class names take precedence of classes imported via wild card
import java.util.Date;

Order of Initialization

- Fields and instance initializer blocks are run in the order in which they appear
- The constructor is run afterwards

"You can’t refer to a variable before it has
been initialized:
{ System.out.println(name); } // DOES NOT COMPILE
private String name = "Fluffy";"

Should be "You can't refer to a variable before it has been declared:".
